This is an atempt to implement the pentago game
I will start off by implementing the game logics and
making it possible to "play" the game in some manner
In the longer term thoughts are:

* Create AI to play against
* Create a javascript enabled site to "play on"
* Make a programmable interface so that you can 
  compete with AI against AI :)
